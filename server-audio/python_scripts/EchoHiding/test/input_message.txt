A program was built to hide an arbitrary file inside audio using three
different methods based on current research in the field. Standard libraries were
used to compress (with bzip2) and encrypt (using AES) the data before it is
embedded. The error-correcting Hamming and Golay codes were implemented
to increase the systems resistance to malicious modification. Finally,the LAME
MP3 encoder was integrated to work with one of the methods (echo hiding). The
finished project provides a means for secure, discreet communication through a
monitored, hostile channel.
